# health_tech
This repository contains the final project developed under an initiative organized by GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit) and Yaba LCDA. The project explores the use of simulated health datasets for analysis, modeling, and basic web application development. Our aim was to simulate, analyze, build a predictive model, and develop a basic application interface to test the model's performance.

## Folders
The repository is structured into several folders, each serving a specific purpose:
The "data" folder contains both the raw health data (CSV format) used for SQL and Power BI analysis, and the simulated data generated using Python.

The "model" folder includes code used for data preprocessing and training a machine learning model.

The "flask_app" folder contains the files for a basic web application, built using Flask, designed to test the model’s predictions. Please note, this application was not deployed.

The "sql query" folder houses SQL scripts used for querying and analyzing the raw health data.

These components demonstrate a full pipeline from data simulation and analysis to model development and application prototyping.

## Tools Used
- Python – Used for data simulation, cleaning, and model development
- Flask – Used to build a simple backend web application
- SQL – For data querying and exploration
- Power BI – To create visual dashboards for insights
- Pandas, NumPy – For data manipulation
- Scikit-learn – For training and testing the machine learning model
- Jupyter Notebook – For prototyping and exploratory data analysis

## Features
- Generation of simulated health data using Python
- Data cleaning and manipulation using Excel and SQL
- Visual data exploration and insights using Power BI
- Predictive modeling with scikit-learn
- A prototype Flask web app for testing model predictions (not deployed)
