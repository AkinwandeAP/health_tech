# health_tech
This repository contains the final project developed under an initiative organized by GIZ (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit) and Yaba LCDA. The project explores the use of simulated health datasets for analysis, modeling, and basic web application development. Our aim was to simulate, analyze, build a predictive model, and develop a basic application interface to test the model's performance.

## The repository is structured into several folders, each serving a specific purpose:
The data folder contains both the raw health data (CSV format) used for SQL and Power BI analysis, and the simulated data generated using Python.

The model folder includes code used for data preprocessing and training a machine learning model.

The flask_app folder contains the files for a basic web application, built using Flask, designed to test the model’s predictions. Please note, this application was not deployed.

The sql folder houses SQL scripts used for querying and analyzing the raw health data.

These components demonstrate a full pipeline from data simulation and analysis to model development and application prototyping.
